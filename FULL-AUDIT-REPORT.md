## Findings

| Severity | Area | Finding | Evidence | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Critical | environment | Missing H1 on page | No primary content heading was detected, which weakens topical clarity. | Ensure each page has exactly one descriptive H1 aligned to intent. |
| Critical | link_profile | Average internal links per page is only 0.0 (target: 5-10). |  | Increase internal linking by adding contextual links within content. |
| Warning | environment | Meta description is missing or out of range | This can reduce SERP CTR and snippet quality. | Update page templates to set complete title/meta/OG/Twitter tags. |
| Warning | environment | Title tag needs optimization | Title length/content is likely suboptimal for rankings and click-through. | Update page templates to set complete title/meta/OG/Twitter tags. |
| Warning | environment | No llms.txt found | AI crawlers and assistants have no curated machine-readable guidance for key pages. | Add `/llms.txt` at site root with concise site description and key URLs. |
| info | broken_links | broken_links measurement incomplete | Failed to fetch page: Blocked: URL resolves to private/internal IP (127.0.0.1) | Rerun this check after resolving the environment/API/network limitation. |
| info | entity | entity measurement incomplete | Failed to fetch http://localhost:3000 | Rerun this check after resolving the environment/API/network limitation. |
| Info | environment | Performance measurement incomplete | PageSpeed API returned an error, so CWV recommendations are less reliable. | Set `PAGESPEED_API_KEY` in your environment or `.env` file (see `.env.example`), then rerun.
